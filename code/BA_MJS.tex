\section{Introduction and outline of this work}

What this thesis is about\ldots

In section \ldots etc.

\section{Regulatory networks in the Thomas formalism}

Insert standard introduction into the formalism here\ldots

\section{Enumeration of regulatory networks}

\subsection{Description of the task and approach}

Reproduce the 9710 networks\ldots

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe the connection between the quasi-continous formalism and the
  Thomas formalism
  \item Enumerate all possible (connected) networks in Python
  \item We will investigate one particular network with only 3 nodes (4 or 5
  including morphogene).
  \item We will apply the strictest possible edge labels ({\tt +} and {\tt -}
  initially).
  \item We will try out all possible values for thresholds and record the
  results for each set.
  \item Later: The dynamics are to be investigated in particular using
  Cytoscape.
  \item Results are to be recorded for CTL filtering, for AL filtering and for
  the combination of CTL filtering and AL filtering.
  \item Next the edge label strictness can be relaxed. Again, all results are to
  be recorded.
  \item Afterwards, this procedure is to be applied for all simple
  stripe-generating networks with three nodes (diffusion to be left out initially).
  \item Finally, networks with more nodes can be investigated.
\end{enumerate}

Check: are diagram and implementation consistent???

TBD: will we store the networks in the database???

\section{Mathematical formulation of the French flag problem}

\subsection{Introduction to the French flag problem}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How to set the maximum thresholds of the network: in the Thomas
  framework, the maximum threshold is given by the number of outgoing edges, but
  one could introduce multiple edges in order to increase the impact of a
  predecessor on a successor node. This question might be investigated
  systematically.
  \item How to set the edge labels of the network: e.g. is an activating node
  {\tt +} or just {\tt obs+} or even another edge label? Again, this question
  might be investigated systematically.
  \item How to define a stripe mathematically? This question must be
  investigated systematically, both in terms of CTL and in terms of AL.
  \item Furthermore, the intersection of the CTL and AL parameter sets must be
  investigated. Are the same parameter sets filtered by AL and CTL? I.e., is a
  stripe under CTL the same as a stripe in AL? If not, is one approach more
  comprehensive than the other?
  \item Results are to be recorded for CTL filtering, for AL filtering and for
  the combination of CTL filtering and AL filtering.
  \item Next the edge label strictness can be relaxed. Again, all results are to
  be recorded.
  \item Afterwards, this procedure is to be applied for all simple
  stripe-generating networks with three nodes (diffusion to be left out initially).
  \item The dynamics are to be investigated in particular using
  Cytoscape.
  \item Finally, networks with more nodes can be investigated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pattern definition in CTL}

The aim of this section is to define what is meant by a ``stripe'' in the
Thomas framework as it is instantiated in the SWP tool. % FIXME: name of tool?
To this end, it is to be noted that in the SWP tool, CTL (and PCTL) formulas can
be filtered by the model checker in two different modes, {\tt forAll} (the default mode) and
{\tt exists}. To understand the difference between these modes, we consider how
a STG is mapped to a computation tree which is processed by the model
checker. An example is displayed in Fig.~\ref{STG2CT}.

We note that in order to convert an STG to a computation tree, the STG must be
rooted as well as ``expanded''. There are equally many ways to root the STG as
there are nodes in the STG. What the function {\tt filter\_byCTL(formula, mode)}
does is, given a CTL formula $\varphi$, 
\begin{itemize}
  \item if {\tt mode == 'forAll'}: it rejects all parameter sets for which
  $\varphi$ evaluates to {\tt False} no matter which state in the STG is used to
  root the computation tree,
  \item if {\tt mode == 'exists'}: it rejects all parameter sets for which
  $\varphi$ evaluates to {\tt False} in at least one computation tree
  corresponding to the STG (i.e. for at least one choice of root).
\end{itemize}

Assuming a non-empty STG, the {\tt forAll} mode is stricter than the {\tt
exists} mode.

It should be noted that in the {\tt exists} mode, there is no way to determine
the starting state (the root) of the computation tree. However, in a dynamical
problem like morphogenesis, one would like to control the starting state or
initial condition of the system. To accomplish this, we use the following
construction: we work in the stricter {\tt forAll} mode and filter by CTL
formulas of the structure
\begin{equation}
{\tt initial\_condition -> final\_condition}.
\end{equation}

In this formula, {\tt initial\_condition} specifies the initial state, e.g. the
activity values of all genes in the network. A longitudinal axis is assumed
along which the morphogen concentration varies. While we work without cell-cell
interaction, each cell can be considered independently irrespective of its
localisation along this axis. The morphogene concentration (which is not
modelled explicitely) then directly translates into the input gene activity. In
our consideration, the input gene will always be called the {\it red gene}. The
red gene activity will therefore be high where the morphogene concentration is
high and low where the morphogene concentration is low.

The final condition needs to be able to express a ``stripe'' pattern in the
output gene (corresponding to the {\it gap gene} in biological literature)
expression, i.e. it needs to display a temporally stable low--high--low pattern,
depending on its inputs. In the following, the output gene will be called the
{\it green gene}. We are now going to formulate the stripe condition in CTL
language.

Recall that our dynamics is described by a non-deterministic automaton which,
together with a starting state is translated into a computation tree. Hence,
requiring that for all nodes eventually the green gene take on a certain
constant value would impose too strong a condition on the network, as it
basically removes all flexibility from the output gene.

So we require the green gene to take on a certain value $x$
{\it globally in the future} but only for all paths starting at a certain
(undetermined) node in the computation tree. This condition allows for other
values $y\neq x$ to be assumed under other conditions.

The CTL representation of this requirement reads
\begin{equation}
{\tt A(initial\_condition  -> EF(AG(gg=}x{\tt )))}.
\end{equation}
In plain language, we require some future paths to exist on which
eventually the output gene takes on value $x$.
